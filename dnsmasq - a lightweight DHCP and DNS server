So this is bringing to me find out exactly which pcs are connected to this switch.

This switch shouldnt have anything to it. But regardless. I should be to somehow "see" that switch in the layout of the network. My question is how. Why did this question never come up in any of my classes?

Now im guessing because I dont fully understand network routing.

Heres what im looking at

inet 10.0.2.15 netmask 255.255.255.0 broacast 10.0.2.255 <-- I set that in the dhcpd.conf, I do not know if that is correct to do?

not really worried about the other info
but from what im reading on this site. 

if I take my broadcast 10.0.2.255, I "THINK" that means I have to the range of 10.0.2.0 , this is all a guess mind you. 

so when i looked at the example on the above page and used some of the documentation I THINK

running:

sudo nmap -sP 10.0.2.0/24
Starting Nmap 7.95 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-06-14 14:24 CDT
Nmap scan report for _gateway ( 10.0.2.2 )
host is up (0.00022s Latency ) 
MAC address: 52:54:00:12:35:02 (QEMU virtual NIC)
nmap scan report for 10.0.2.3
...
...
...
...
Host is up.
Nmap done: 256 IP address ( 4 hosts up ) scanned in 3.16 seconds.

wtf does that all mean?

oddly
when I run 
csmone@chile:~$ arp -a
