I Installed fedora 39 server on chile but I am not sure if that is the direction im actually looking to go. That doesn't give me any of the graphical options
I believe you are looking for. I see documentation on "GuestOS" but that seems to be a paid service which is not being used by UNH. I am going
to go back and look at more of these boot options because I think I am complicating things.
- Actually that documentation sends me right back to here:
- https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/f36/install-guide/advanced/Network_based_Installations/#chap-pxe-server-setup
- perhaps I am not off the mark, I am going to continue forward using fedora 39 server.
