Configuring the PXE boot environment
Providing and configuring bootloaders for PXE clients
Getting the bootloader files

    Get the syslinux bootloader for BIOS clients.

        Install the syslinux package.

        # dnf install syslinux

        Create a directory for the bootloader files, and make them available there.

        # mkdir -p /var/lib/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg
        # cp /usr/share/syslinux/{pxelinux.0,menu.c32,vesamenu.c32,ldlinux.c32,libcom32.c32,libutil.c32} /var/lib/tftpboot/

    Get the bootloader files for UEFI systems

        Install the shim-x64 and grub2-efi-x64 packages. If your server is a BIOS system, you must install the packages to a temporary install root. Installing them directly on a BIOS machine will attempt to configure the system for UEFI booting and cause problems.

        # dnf install shim-x64 grub2-efi-x64 --installroot=/tmp/fedora --releasever 36

        Create a directory for the bootloader files, and make them available there.

        # mkdir -p /var/lib/tftpboot/uefi
        # cp /tmp/fedora/boot/efi/EFI/fedora/{shimx64.efi,grubx64.efi} /var/lib/tftpboot/uefi/

All of this worked just replacing "36" with "39"
So, I am going to continue on just doctoring the script HOPING that fedora addresses are accurate..
